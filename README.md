# RaylibEX

Raylib Extra is my attempt to incorporate more basic functionality to <a href="http://www.raylib.com/index.html">Raylib</a> created by Ray while still keeping the hands-on feeling C++ coding aspect which drew me to Raylib in the first place!

The additions being:
	A more standard way to handle scenes
	Game Objects (in this case entities)
	Components (which you attach to entities to give them various behaviours)
	Animated 3D models (using .dae, Collada files) 
	2D animated sprites
	Lua scripting
	
I try to keep things fairly simple, you simply need to add the header and source files to your Raylib project and tell the compiler where to look in order to get the EXtra functionality!
Or at least, that's the idea!
	
There is still a lot to be done.

To Do
	Clean up the main code structure
	Get to work on Animated 3D models
	Lua scripting
	Example projects
